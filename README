Abstract:

An FPS game based on soccer/football. The player
is a soccer player, and has to play several soccer 
matches against numerous opponents. The base
mechanic is to run around and fire soccer balls
at enemies, with the goal being to kill and
dismember them. Points are scored by lobbing 
opponents' body parts into the opposition's goal.
The player can also be attacked by the opposing
players, and every time he is killed, the opposition
scores points based on level of dismemberment. 
The match ends when either side gets a preset amount
of points (e.g., 20).
